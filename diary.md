First day: 
- I started my project
- first I rewatched how we did the PacMan game, because my game is very similar to it
- at the end of the day I had the basic game map and a movable character

Second day:
- I started the day with the attempt of implementing the enemy, but I had a hard time with it, so I gave up that part for the day
- I changed the speed and the movement of the character
- I added a timer

Third day:
- another struggling with the enemy implementation (still failing)
- starting to do the styling of the cover page
- and FINALLY I successfully implemented the enemies :)))

Fourth day: 
- plan for the day: trying to do the score display and the retry button for the game to be replayable
- I made that the score is increases with 1 when the object is collected
- I also implemented the retry button
- changing things in CSS

Fifth day:
- because some people suggested, I increased the speed
- tried some things, but not so successful (for now)

Sixth day:
- drawing for animations

Seventh day:
- trying to put in the animations

Eighth day: 
- finishing the game, last touch ups
